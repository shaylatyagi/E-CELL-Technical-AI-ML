### Project Description
This project involves developing a binary image classifier to differentiate between cats and dogs using machine learning techniques. The classifier is built using TensorFlow and tested on a dataset of images. The website allows users to test the model using their webcam or by uploading image files.

### Usage
You can test the model using the website, which provides options to use a webcam or upload image files. Follow the instructions below to use the functionalities:

1. **Access the Model:**
   - Visit the website: [Model Testing Website](https://sites.google.com/view/shaylatyagi/home)
   - You can test the model using your webcam or by uploading images of cats and dogs.

2. **Website Functionalities:**
   - **Webcam:** Use your webcam to capture an image and classify it as a cat or dog.
   - **Upload File:** Upload an image file to classify it as a cat or dog.
   - The website also displays the confusion matrix and provides links to additional resources.

3. **Video Demonstration:**
   - Watch the video demonstration recorded on Loom: [Deployment Video](https://www.loom.com/share/2d9c90f72dc24415b4712ab6be161b9f?sid=7fef043a-2e98-4f3f-ad26-a33eb5f315f6)
